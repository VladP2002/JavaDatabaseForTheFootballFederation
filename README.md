# Java Database App For The Football Federation

  Along with one colleague, we created a Java application dedicated
to the Football Federation to store players, coaches, teams and
sponsors in one place.
  The App is available with multiple user modes and different features:
    -Admin (ex: CRUD operations)
    -Guest (ex: view/search/filter all repositories)
    -Player (ex: register yourself, compare to other existing players)
    -Coach (ex: sign/release players from current squad)
    -Sponsor (ex: start/end sponsorship deals with existing teams)
